# DataScience_GettingAndCleaningData_JHU

## Course Project
This repo is part of the course project for Data Science Specialisation - Getting and Cleaning Data at Johns Hopkins University

## Instructions
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 

## Review criteria 
- The submitted data set is tidy.
- The Github repo contains 
    - the required scripts - run_analysis.R
    - a code book - Codebook.md - that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
    - a readme - README.md - that explains the analysis files and is clear and understandable.
- The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
 
So this file explains the contents of this repository:
- the run-analysis.R file contains the scripts used to get the requested result
- the codebook.md contains the description of the file contents, the source and the manipulations to get the result
